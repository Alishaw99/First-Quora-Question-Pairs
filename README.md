Data Overview
Available Columns: id, qid1, qid2, question1, question2, is_duplicate
Class labels: 0, 1
Total training data / No. of rows: 404290
No. of columns: 6
is_duplicate is the dependent variable.
No. of non-duplicate data points is 255027
No. of duplicate data points is 149263

We have 404290 training data points. And only 36.92% are positive. That means it is an imbalanced dataset.

**Data Cleaning**
We have converted everything to lower case.
We have removed contractions.
We have replaced currency symbols with currency names.
We have also removed hyperlinks.
We have removed non-alphanumeric characters.
We have removed inflections with word lemmatizer.
We have also removed HTML tags.
**Feature Extraction**
We have created 23 features from the questions.

We have created features q1_char_num, q2_char_num with count of characters for both questions.
We have created features q1_word_num, q2_word_num with count of characters for both questions.
We have created total_word_num feature which is equal to sum of q1_word_num and q2_word_num.
We have created differ_word_num feature which is absolute difference between q1_word_num and q2_word_num.
We have created same_first_word feature which is 1 if both questions have same first word otherwise 0.
We have created same_last_word feature which is 1 if both questions have same last word otherwise 0.
We have created total_unique_word_num feature which is equal to total number of unique words in both questions.
We have created total_unique_word_withoutstopword_num feature which is equal to total number of unique words in both questions without the stop words.
The total_unique_word_num_ratio is equal to total_unique_word_num divided by total_word_num.
We have created common_word_num feature which is count of total common words in both questions.
The common_word_ratio feature is equal to common_word_num divided by total_unique_word_num.
The common_word_ratio_min is equal to common_word_num divided by minimum number of words between question 1 and question 2.
The common_word_ratio_max is equal to common_word_num divided by maximum number of words between question 1 and question 2.
We have created common_word_withoutstopword_num feature which is count of total common words in both questions excluding the stopwords.
The common_word_withoutstopword_ratio feature is equal to common_word_withoutstopword_num divided by total_unique_word_withoutstopword_num.
The common_word_withoutstopword_ratio_min is equal to common_word_withoutstopword_num divided by minimum number of words between question 1 and question 2 excluding the stopwords.
The common_word_withoutstopword_ratio_max is equal to common_word_withoutstopword_num divided by maximum number of words between question 1 and question 2 excluding the stopwords.
Then we have extracted fuzz_ratio, fuzz_partial_ratio, fuzz_token_set_ratio and fuzz_token_sort_ratio features with fuzzywuzzy string matching tool. Reference: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy
